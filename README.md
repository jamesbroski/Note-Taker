# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

This assignment, we were to create note application that allows the user to save custom notes and display them at a later date.

This application utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript, (more specifically, Node.js & Express.js)

This application is using both front-end and back-end frameworks so the user can not only interact with the application, but can have their data saved on a server, which can be retrieved if desired. 

Below is a screenshot of what the user can expect to see:

Here is the deployed link to use the application: https://nameless-sea-58829.herokuapp.com/
